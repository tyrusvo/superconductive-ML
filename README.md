# superconductive-ML   
Prediction of superconductive materials' critical temperature with machine learning.   
The project uses machine learning packages from sklearn to find the best method of predicting critical temperature.  
Physical and chemical data are obtained via matminer.  
Data obtained from Dr. Husayin.  
Speical thanks to Dr. Ucar Husayin and Dr. Shyue Ping Ong.
